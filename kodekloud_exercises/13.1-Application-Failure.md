    ==> WRONG SERVICE-NAME

    NOTE: Just had to change svc's name (from "mysql" to "mysql-service")
       
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
        name: mysql-service
        namespace: alpha
    spec:
      clusterIP: 10.96.78.122
      clusterIPs:
      - 10.96.78.122
      ports:
      - port: 3306
        protocol: TCP
        targetPort: 3306
      selector:
        name: mysql
      sessionAffinity: None
      type: ClusterIP
    status:
      loadBalancer: {}

kubens() { if [ -n "$1" ]; then k config set-context --current --namespace=$1 && kubens; else k config view --minify | grep namespace | sed "s/namespace://" | xargs; fi; }

kubens() { echo $1 | grep -e "^[[:blank:]]*$" || k config set-context --current --namespace=$1; k config view --minify | grep namespace | sed "s/namespace://" | xargs; }

    ==> WRONG TARGET-PORT


    root@controlplane:~# kg svc -owide
    NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE     SELECTOR
    mysql-service   ClusterIP   10.97.113.27   <none>        3306/TCP         9m27s   name=mysql
    web-service     NodePort    10.97.70.146   <none>        8080:30081/TCP   9m26s   name=webapp-mysql
    root@controlplane:~# kg pods --show-labels
    NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     LABELS
    mysql                           1/1     Running   0          9m38s   name=mysql
    webapp-mysql-75dfdf859f-bbz6s   1/1     Running   0          9m37s   name=webapp-mysql,pod-template-hash=75dfdf859f


    DAMN. Port here is correct...
    root@controlplane:~# kg svc -owide
    NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE   SELECTOR
    mysql-service   ClusterIP   10.97.113.27   <none>        3306/TCP         22m   name=mysql
    web-service     NodePort    10.97.70.146   <none>        8080:30081/TCP   22m   name=webapp-mysql

    ... But Target-Port is actually wrong (Should be 3306)
    root@controlplane:~# kd svc/mysql-service
    Name:              mysql-service
    Namespace:         beta
    Labels:            <none>
    Annotations:       <none>
    Selector:          name=mysql
    Type:              ClusterIP
    IP Families:       <none>
    IP:                10.97.113.27
    IPs:               10.97.113.27
    Port:              <unset>  3306/TCP
    TargetPort:        8080/TCP
    Endpoints:         10.244.0.8:8080
    Session Affinity:  None
    Events:            <none>
